# TryHackMe Learning Journal

This repository documents my cybersecurity learning journey through TryHackMe (Sec0 and Sec1 paths).  
It is a study journal and portfolio of conceptual notes, commands used (no solutions), and diagrams.

## Purpose
- Track hands-on learning and retention
- Share study notes with peers and recruiters
- Link to on LinkedIn as a learning artefact

## Structure
- `Sec0/` — foundational rooms (Linux, networking, basics)
- `Sec1/` — introductory security (scanning, enumeration, privilege escalation)
- `screenshots/` — diagrams and non-sensitive images

## About me
9 years in IT. Recent certifications: CompTIA A+, ITIL 4, Microsoft AZ-900, SC-900, AI-900, ISC² CC.  
I use this repo to show practical learning and to demonstrate that I apply knowledge, not just aim for exam passes.
